                        I am going to create a website that can be used for online shopping, just like Nike or Adidas official website. For the main page, I will create a header which include website name, item classification, and user registration, login and other functions. For the body of content part, there will be h1, h2, and h3 to list the single product recommendation, new clothing of the season, and fashion trend. I will also create a side element to list all the clothing brands. Finally, the copyright of the website will be included in footer.
