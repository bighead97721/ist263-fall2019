             <td>During that internship, my learning focus was on electrical engineering. The first month was to follow the principles of other engineers to learn the controller and the computer software that electrical engineers need to apply. Learn how to program through a computer software to control the entire large machine, such as robots, boards, etc.  
                    In the second month, I went to the factory floor with my advisor or manager to do the actual operation. I participated in the assembly of the board, which is an experimental model for university graduates and a visit to the exhibition.
